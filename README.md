# NonicaTab PRO
✔️ NonicaTab creates a new Autodesk® Revit® toolbar with 12 buttons easy to customize with your Dynamo scripts and favourite icons.

✔️ This FREE Revit Add In runs Dynamo in the background and pops up any input window such as Data Shapes package input nodes. NonicaTab notifies in real time if the script was run successfully or with errors or warnings with Dynamo versions from 2.0.
